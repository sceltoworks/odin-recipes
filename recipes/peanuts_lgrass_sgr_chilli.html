    </p>
<h2> Equipment</h2>
<ul><li>Carbon Steel Wok</li></ul>
<h2> Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
    <li>500 grams shelled raw peanuts - pink 'skins' still on</li>
    <li> ½ tbsp of vegetable oil</li>
    <li>1 tsp sea salt - or more to taste</li>
    <li>1 tsp refined sugar - or more for sweet-toothed guests</li>
    <li>4 dried bird’s eye chillies - deseeded and chopped finely</li>
    <li> 6 kaffir lime leaves - centre torn out and ripped into small pieces</li>
    <li> 1 clove of garlic - sliced very thinly</li>
    <li>15 cm piece of lemongrass - tough outer skin removed and sliced very finely</li>
    <li></li>
</ul>

<h2> Steps</h2>
<ol>
    <li>    Heat a large wok over high heat. </li>
    <li>  Add the peanuts, stir constantly and reduce the heat to medium-low after a couple of minutes.</li>
    <li>  Once the peanuts start to colour (this should be around 5 minutes), turn the heat up a little as you slowly add the oil. Keep stirring to distribute the oil evenly.</li>  
    <li>Add salt, chillies, lemongrass and the sugar and stir well.</li>
    <li>Add the garlic.</li>
    <li>The nuts are fully roasted when they are bright red. A little bit of brown is good too. Add the kaffir lime leaves.</li>
    <li>Remove the nuts from the wok and place on an oven tray lined with greaseproof paper and allow to cool before serving.</li>
    <li>If there are any nuts left after serving, store in an airtight container.</li>
</ol>
